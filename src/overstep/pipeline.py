"""The run pipeline: matrix in, RunResult out.

This is the orchestration seam. The CLI (and any embedding application) hands a
matrix to :func:`run_pipeline` and gets back a :class:`RunResult`; all the
input/output concerns — argument parsing, printing, file writing — live in the
CLI, and all the domain logic — planning, executing, classifying, drift — is
composed here. The executor is injectable so the pipeline can be tested without a
live target.
